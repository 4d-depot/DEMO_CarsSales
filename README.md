# Cars4DRent
Cars4DRent showcases the capabilities of 4D Write Pro in generating documents with minimum of coding. This project served as the source material for our 4D Write Pro demonstration video, which you can view below. 
We're providing the Cars4DRent resources in full transparency to inspire your own projects!


**Key Features of Cars4DRent**
Â 
- **Leverage 4D Write Pro Templates**: Discover how to use 4D Write Pro templates to generate documents. These templates minimize the need for extensive 4D coding, resulting in simpler and more maintainable code.
- **Context-Aware Documents**: Explore how to associate contexts with your templates to produce dynamic documents that adapt to specific situations.
- **Reduced Code Complexity**: Witness how creating a template (primarily involving graphical layout and basic formulas) significantly reduces the amount of 4D code required. The code responsible for generating invoices in Cars4DRent is remarkably concise, consisting of only around fifteen lines (see "InvoicesSelection" class and "printInvoices" function).
